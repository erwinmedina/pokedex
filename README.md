> Issues:
- There are pokemon with multi evolution chains, such as Eevee, and i'm currently unable to differentiate between which chain to choose or how to illustrate it correctly.
- The dropdown selectors aren't functioning at 100%, they're almost there but struggle when you click on "Type" and then "Gen + Type". 
- It can be a second too slow to load information. Need better algorithms to solve these issues.
