# Erwin's Pokedex
## Motivation:
I've always enjoyed playing pokemon when I was growing up. I've been a huge fan since generation 1 until about generation 6, then I fell off the wagon. I felt that I would be capable of creating a pokedex that would illustrate pokemon evolutions, pokemon moves, and being able to filter between generations and pokemon types. Because the PokeAPI was easy to use and manipulate, I moved forward with that API and utilized it to create state data that populates the information shown in the images below.

In the future, I would like to improve the CSS. And I would like to implement a bit more detail to the data such as adding the weaknesses/strengths of Pokemon. 

## Technology:
- HTML / CSS
- Javascript / React
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## How to Use:

## Issues:
- There are pokemon with multi evolution chains, such as Eevee, and i'm currently unable to differentiate between which chain to choose or how to illustrate it correctly.
- The dropdown selectors aren't functioning at 100%, they're almost there but struggle when you click on "Type" and then "Gen + Type". 
- It can be a second too slow to load information. Need better algorithms to solve these issues.
